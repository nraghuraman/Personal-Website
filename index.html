                    <p>Currently, I am a part of the original founding team on a project to develop a safer method of obtaining data from hurricanes—through high-altitude helium balloons! As a part of this team, I have contributed to the development of a vent for helium at the balloon's apex to increase the length of flight possible. Additionally, I have worked on the avionics for the balloon's payload using the Arduino language and numerous sensors. These are all aspects of our project which are necessary for the successful flight of our balloon.</p>

            <h3>U.S. Presidential Scholars Semifinalist</h3>
            <p>Among nearly 4,500 candidates for the program, I was selected as one of 630 semifinalists. The program was initiated in 1964 as an Executive Order of the President. Candidates are selected among all graduating seniors in the country for either SAT or ACT score, excellence in the arts, or excellence in career or technical fields. Semifinalists are selected among the candidates following an application process.</p>
            <h3>Perfect Score on 2018 AP Research Exam</h3>

A few years later, I started playing the saxophone. Over the years, I have performed in numerous Indian classical concerts, including a two-hour-long solo concert in June 2018, and have played saxophone in a variety of classical and jazz ensembles.

I have C1 "advanced" certification for the language under the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, and have obtained the Indiana Certificate of Multilingual Proficiency. Additionally, the summer before my senior year of high school, I was one of 44 students across the United States selected for German language skills to take part in a 3-week all-expense-paid trip to Germany. In the picture, you can see me in Munich, or, as the Germans call it, M&#x00FC;nchen!</p>

                    <p>Origami is one of my biggest hobbies, and I've been a fan of this art form since elementary school. Over the years, I've folded hundreds (and possibly thousands) of origami models, and have even designed dozens of my own origami models. I especially enjoy geometric origami, including tessellations and fractals. Moreover, I have been teaching origami for a few years, including being the president and co-founder of my high school's Origami Club and teaching an origami class to a group of high school students as a part of Stanford Splash. What you see in the picture is an independently-discovered design and one of my most recent creations. It's a fractal which has been rotated and tessellated four times!</p>
