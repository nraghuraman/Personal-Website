                        <h2>about me</h2>
                        <p>My number one passion is constant learning, and this underscores everything I do. From my free time to the student groups I’m a part of, I strive to treat every situation as a chance to grow.</p>
                        <p>As a student at Stanford University majoring in Computer Science, I am pushing myself to learn as much about engineering as possible. I am a member of Stanford Student Space Initiative’s Cycloon team, which is developing helium balloons which may eventually revolutionize hurricane data collection. Thus far, I have developed a helium vent for the apex of a Cycloon balloon, which is vital for the system's long-distance flight. Additionally, I have worked on the programming of flight avionics using Arduino. I am also looking forward to beginning as a CS 106A section leader in the autumn as a part of Stanford's CS 198 program. In this role, I will teach a section of 8-12 students as a part of Stanford's introductory computer science sequence.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I am looking forward to using my school breaks as an opportunity to delve further into the fields that excite me. This summer, I am working at Software Engineering Professionals in Carmel, IN as a Software Engineering Intern. Simultaneously, I am working on a software project as an Innovation Fellow with NeuroLex Labs. I am thrilled to have these opportunities to learn more about the field of software engineering and grow my skill set.</p>
                        <p>In my free time, I enjoy studying linguistics, watching YouTube videos on any and every topic, and designing and folding my own origami models.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for visiting my website!</p>

                    <p>In this role, I am working on a web application with thousands of users for a Fortune 500 company written with React. I am also working on a Java backend. As I continue with this internship, I anticipate gaining experience with Node.js, software testing using Spring Dependency Injection, and debugging, in addition to JavaScript, React, and Java. Furthermore, I am working on a team which makes significant use of the Scrum model of software development.</p>

                    <h3>Stanford Student Space Initiative Member, Stanford University, October 2018-Present</h3>
                    <p>Currently, I am a part of the original founding team on a project to develop a safer method of obtaining data from hurricanes—through high-altitude helium balloons! As a part of this team, I have contributed to the development of a vent for helium at the balloon's apex to increase the length of flight possible. Additionally, I have worked on the avionics for the balloon's payload using the Arduino language and numerous sensors. These are all aspects of our project which are necessary for the successful flight of our balloon.</p>

            <h3>Perfect Score on 2017 AP Calculus BC Exam</h3>
            <p>I was one of the 3 students in the world out of 133,000 test takers to receive a perfect score on the exam. As a result, I was interviewed for an article by the Indianapolis Star, which you can read <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/education/2018/04/13/carmel-student-1-3-people-world-get-perfect-ap-calculus-score/499880002/">here</a>. I was also mentioned on social media by my U.S. Representative, Susan Brooks.<p>
            <h3>U.S. Presidential Scholars Semifinalist</h3>
            <p>Among nearly 4,500 candidates for the program, I was selected as one of 630 semifinalists. The program was initiated in 1964 as an Executive Order of the President. Candidates are selected among all graduating seniors in the country for either SAT or ACT score, excellence in the arts, or excellence in career or technical fields. Semifinalists are selected among the candidates following an application process.</p>
            <h3>Perfect Score on 2018 AP Research Exam</h3>
            <p>I was one of 111 students out of 9,640 in the world to receive a perfect score on this exam, my second perfect score on an Advanced Placement examination.</p>
            <h3>American Association of Teachers of German Study Trip Award</h3>

                    <p>For years, I have been an avid musician. As a young child, I started taking Indian classical vocal lessons as well as Indian classical percussion lessons. A few years later, I started playing the saxophone. Over the years, I have given numerous Indian classical concerts, including a two-hour-long solo concert in June 2018, and have played saxophone in a variety of classical and jazz ensembles.

I have C1 "advanced" certification for the language under the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, and have obtained the Indiana Certificate of Multilingual Proficiency. Additionally, the summer before my senior year of high school, I was one of 44 students across the United States selected for German language skills to take part in a 3-week all-expense-paid trip to Germany. See me in Munich in the picture, or, as the Germans call it, M&#x00FCnchen!</p>

                    <p>Origami is one of my biggest hobbies, and I've been a fan of this art form since elementary school. Over the years, I've folded hundreds (and possibly thousands) of origami models, and have even designed dozens of my own origami models. I especially enjoy geometric origami, including tessellations and fractals. I have been teaching origami for a few years, including being the president and co-founder of my high school's Origami Club and teaching an origami class to a group of high school students as a part of Stanford Splash. What you see in the picture is an independently-discovered design and one of my most recent creations. It's a fractal which has been rotated and tessellated four times!</p>
