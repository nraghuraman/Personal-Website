                    <p>Currently, I am a part of the original founding team on a project to develop a safer method of obtaining data from hurricanesâ€”through high-altitude helium balloons! As a part of this team, I have contributed to the development of a vent for helium at the balloon's apex to increase the length of flight possible. Additionally, I have worked on the avionics for the balloon's payload using the Arduino language and numerous sensors. These are all aspects of our project which are necessary for the successful flight of our balloon.</p>

            <h3>Perfect Score on 2017 AP Calculus BC Exam</h3>
            <p>I was one of the 3 students in the world out of 133,000 test takers to receive a perfect score on the exam. As a result, I was interviewed for a front-page article by the Indianapolis Star, which you can read <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/education/2018/04/13/carmel-student-1-3-people-world-get-perfect-ap-calculus-score/499880002/">here</a>. I was also mentioned on social media by my Representative in U.S. Congress, Susan Brooks.<p>
            <h3>U.S. Presidential Scholars Semifinalist</h3>
            <p>Among nearly 4,500 candidates for the program, I was selected as one of 630 semifinalists. The program was initiated in 1964 as an Executive Order of the President. Candidates are selected among all graduating seniors in the country for either SAT or ACT score, excellence in the arts, or excellence in career or technical fields. Semifinalists are selected among the candidates following an application process. As a candidate in this program, I was recognized in the Indiana State Capitol by Indiana Senator Mike Delph.</p>
            <h3>Perfect Score on 2018 AP Research Exam</h3>
            <p>I was one of 111 students out of 9,640 in the world to receive a perfect score on this exam, my second perfect score on an Advanced Placement examination.</p>
            <h3>American Association of Teachers of German Study Trip Award</h3>
            <p>I received this all-expense-paid 3-week trip to Germany funded by the German government. Over 20,000 students of German sat for the National German Exam. Those who scored in the 90th percentile were eligible to apply, and of those who applied, 44 were selected.</p>
            <h3>National Merit Scholar</h3>
            <p>I was selected as one of 7,500 recipients of the National Merit Scholarship from the pool of 1.6 million PSAT test-takers.</p>
            <h3>Outstanding Math Department Senior</h3>
            <p>Each year, each academic department in my high school names one senior from the more than 1100 graduating seniors the "outstanding senior" for that department based upon work performed throughout high school. I was selected for the mathematics department award during my senior year.</p>
            <h3>Distinguished Graduate</h3>
            <p>I was named one of approximately 30 Distinguished Graduates among the more than 1100 students in my high school graduating class. Criteria for selection included academic achievement and involvement in school activities.</p>

A few years later, I started playing the saxophone. Over the years, I have performed in numerous Indian classical concerts, including a two-hour-long solo concert in June 2018, and have played saxophone in a variety of classical and jazz ensembles.

I have C1 "advanced" certification for the language under the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, and have obtained the Indiana Certificate of Multilingual Proficiency. Additionally, the summer before my senior year of high school, I was one of 44 students across the United States selected for German language skills to take part in a 3-week all-expense-paid trip to Germany. In the picture, you can see me in Munich, or, as the Germans call it, M&#x00FC;nchen!</p>

                    <p>Origami is one of my biggest hobbies, and I've been a fan of this art form since elementary school. Over the years, I've folded hundreds (and possibly thousands) of origami models, and have even designed dozens of my own origami models. I especially enjoy geometric origami, including tessellations and fractals. Moreover, I have been teaching origami for a few years, including being the president and co-founder of my high school's Origami Club and teaching an origami class to a group of high school students as a part of Stanford Splash. What you see in the picture is an independently-discovered design and one of my most recent creations. It's a fractal which has been rotated and tessellated four times!</p>
