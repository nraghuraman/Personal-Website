# Personal-Website
This is a personal website which I created to explain a little bit about myself. I created it with HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and JavaScript. Feel free to visit it at nikhilraghuraman.com!

This was my first experience with website design. I'm proud of the details I was able to incorporate, such as animations in the navigation bar and the smooth scrolling in Firefox and Chrome.

Remaining defects:
-Smooth scroll only works on Firefox and Chrome, because these are the only two browsers which support the method used
-Currently only Chrome properly disables scroll while the animation is playing
-Favicon is not properly displaying on every browser
