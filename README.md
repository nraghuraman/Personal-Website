# Personal-Website
This is a personal website which I created to explain a little bit about myself. I coded it with HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and JavaScript.

Remaining defects:
-Smooth scroll only works on Firefox and Chrome, because these are the only two browsers which support the method used
-Currently only Chrome properly disables scroll while the animation is playing
-Favicon is not properly displaying on every browser
